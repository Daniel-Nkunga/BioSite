              <p>If you tried to tell me just a year earlier that in my final summer before freshmany year of college I would be staying in Alabama for an internship, I not only would've not believed you, I would've thought you were crazy. Despite my hesitation, I found myself in Huntsville, Alabama the summer following my senior year of high school. During the weekend of the 2024 solar eclipse, I met Mundy Reimer who was visiting my school and quickly introduced me to the company he worked for, Leidos Dyntics, and suggested that I should apply for the internship. After a series of emails, an interview, and a lot of excitement, I soon found myself as an engineering intern under both Mundy Reimer and Kyle Nicholson where I would be learning a lot about the development of Transformers for Large Language Models.  </p>
            </div>
            <p>I'm grateful for both the work opportunity and the learning experience I had at Leidos Dyntics and would highly recommend the experience to anyone interested (assuming I don't go back there myself!).</p>
            <p>This page will just be a general overview of what I did during my summer at Leidos Dyntics, but for day-to-day, specific projects, or other things accomplised over my time there, please explore the links at the top of the page</p>

            <h2><a href = "index.html">Project Specifics</a></h2>
            <div class = "intro">
              <p>Throughout my internship at Leidos Dyntics, I worked unter the guidance of Mundy Reimer as a part of the AI research and development team. I worked on a project centered around the integration of LLMs into their simulation work. </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "text">
            <p>The first major project I completed was creating a AI commentator for their simulations using LLaMA as a base and parsing information from JSON files. My main takeaways from this project were the research done in finding the best models to use for a given case, how to read and edit the code for larger applications and how to go about fixing solutions local to my machine, and the process of fine tuning a model from a general use case to something more fitting to the task I want to accomplish. </p>

            <h2><a href = "AtLB.html">Book Club</a></h2>
            <div class = "intro">
              <p>It's not often that I read books purely for their educational value, but over the course of the summer, I read Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths's <u>Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions</u> with Mundy and the other interns I was working with. Though I won't promise an in-depth book review or an insightful commentary on the true nature of man through the lens of this book, if you would like to read a few of my thoughts about the book, please click here.  </p>

            <h2><a href = "Journal.html">Journal Club</a></h2>
            <div class = "intro">
              <p>I read educational papers even less than I read educational books (which as I noted above is not much), but throughout the internship I also read quite a few scientific papers and journals with my fellow interns to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence and the computer science world as a whole. I won't be beautifully summarizing the articles and their complex thoughts, but if you would like to read about some of my thoughts, please click here.   </p>
