            <p>Over the summer of 2024, I had the privilege of working for them as an intern at the Dynetics Solutions Complex in Huntsville, AL. There, under the guidance of Mundy Reimer and Kyle Nicholson, I worked on the development of transformer and artificial intelligence development adapted for their internal projects. </p>
            <p>This page will just go over the the of all the projects done over the courrse of this internship. For more detail on a week to week work this internship provided me, please click here.</p>

            <h2>Transformer Development</h2>
            <p>Over the first few week in Huntsville, a lot of my projects we focused on the development and implementation of transformers to generate text for a simulation. Though I researched many large language models and transformers through my first week, the model was ultimately developed using ___ as a base and fine tuning to fit the company needs.</p>

            <h2>HEDONIST ROOTS</h2>
            <p>Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:

                “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”
                The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.
                
                The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of lorem ipsum.</p>
