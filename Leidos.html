        <h1>LEIDOS</h1>
        <p><a href = "https://www.leidos.com/">Leidos</a> is an engineering company with sectors in aerospace, national defense, and innovation and company locations across the nation. </p>
        <p>Over the summer of 2024, I had the privilege of working for them as an intern at the Dynetics Solutions Complex in Huntsville, AL. There, under the guidance of Mundy Reimer and Kyle Nicholson, I worked on the development of transformer and artificial intelligence development adapted for their internal projects. </p>

            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>Though a lot of the details of the projects cannot be elaborated on due to security issues, an overview statement over the projects I worked on over my time there will be given.</p>

            <h2>Transformer Development</h2>
            <p>Over the first few week in Huntsville, a lot of my projects we focused on the development and implementation of transformers to generate text for a simulation. Though I researched many large language models and transformers through my first week, the model was ultimately developed using ___ as a base and fine tuning to fit the company needs.</p>

        <p>Though the time I had there was only limited to eight weeks, I am grateful for the opportunity to work for and learn under Leidos. </p>
