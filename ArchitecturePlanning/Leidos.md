_Intro Paragraph_

If you had tried to explain to me just a year earlier that in the coming summer I would be staying in Alabama for an internship, I now only would've not believed you, I would've thought you were crazy. Despite my hesitation, I found myself in Huntsville, Alabama the summer following my senior year of high school. Through the insd of the 2024 eclipse, I met Mundy Reimer who quickly introduced me to the company he worked for, Leidos, and suggested that I'd apply for the internship. After a series of emails, an interview, and a lot of excitement, I found myself as an engineering intern under both Mundy Reimer and Kyle Nicholson where I would be learning a lot about the development of Transformers for Large Language Models. 

I'm grateful for both the work opportunity and the learning experience I ha at Leidos and would highly recommend the experience to anyone interested (assuming I don't go back there myself!).

Though this page will just be a general overview of what I did at my summer at Leidos, for specifics on the day-to-day, specific projects, or other things accomplished over my time there, please explore the links at the top of the page. [WIP: Create banner at the top of the page with links to other pages]

_Project Specifics_

Throughout my internship at Leidos, I was under the guidance of Mundy Rimer as a part of the research development team under the ________ team. There I worked on a multitude revolving around the integration of LLM for their simulation. [WIP: Elaborate on all projects worked on over time there]

_Book Club_

It's not often that I read books not for pure enjoyment, but over the course of the summer, I read Brain Christian and Tom Griffiths's Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions with Mundy and the other interns I was working with. Though I won't promise an in-depth book review or an insightful commentary on the true nature of man through the lens of this book, if you would like to read a few of my thoughts about the book, please click here.

_Journal Club_

I read educational papers even less that I read educational books (which as I noted above is not much), but throughout the internship I also read quite a few scientific papers and journals with my fellow interns to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence and the computer science world as a whole. I won't be beautifully summarizing the articles and their complex thoughts, but if you would like to read about some of mine, please click here. [Create a page for journal club]
