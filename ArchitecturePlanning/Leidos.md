Links: [[Leidos Week 1]]

[Leidos](https://www.leidos.com/) is an engineering company with sectors in aerospace, national defense, and innovation and company locations across the nation. 

Over the summer of 2024, I had the privilege of working for them as an intern at the Dynetics Solutions Complex in Huntsville, AL. There, under the guidance of Mundy Reimer and Kyle Nicholson, I worked on the development of transformer and artificial intelligence development adapted for their internal projects. 

**Project Summary**

Though a lot of the details of the projects cannot be elaborated on due to security issues, an overview statement over the projects I worked on over my time there will be given.

**Transformer Development**

Over the first few week in Huntsville, a lot of my projects we focused on the development and implementation of transformers to generate text for a simulation. Though I researched many large language models and transformers through my first week, the model was ultimately developed using ___ as a base and fine tuning to fit the company needs.

**Experience Summary**

Though the time I had there was only limited to eight weeks, I am grateful for the opportunity to work for and learn under Leidos.
