## Summary
A new court law had just stated that clones are a unique entity from their source and cannot be treated as property. They have their own rights and all claims of "the original" are not automatically passed on. This means that if you can clone someone, they are an entire new person while being the exact same person. **NAME** wants to use this "loophole" to revive her husband. He died a few years ago when the cloning technology was just on the cusp of existing and said he didn't want to be brought back through a clone. But **NAME** knows her husband would do anything for her. She knows if her husband knew how lonely she was and how much she was suffering without him that he would surely come back for her, but is she lying herself and doing all these things because she just selfishly wants him back.
