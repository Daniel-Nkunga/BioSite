- Typical problem: classification, multiclass, regression, unsupervised (no labels), supervised (labels)
	- Supervised vs. unsupervised deals more with the information coming into the model; if the data coming in is unlabeled, it is unsupervised
- Decision function: the line that classifies a new entry to a scatterplot
	- Sometimes called the decision boundary and decision surface in higher dimensions 
- Dot Products: "sum of products"
	- Euclidian notation
	- Coefficients: weight vector
		- This changes; the model leans this 
	- (x,y): input vector
		- This is the data
	- extraneous term: bias term
		- Can be changed both before or after slope has been changed
- Linearly separable: can be defined by a line
	- Opposite: non-linearly separable
- **Bring notebook next time
- Summantion notation of x and weights = y=mx_b
	- weights are your slope
- Activation Function: function that is able to create a nonlinear function
- Sigmoid Function (Squashing Function): forces your input into a number between zero and one 
- **Can you have a three dimensional version of the sigmoid function that has both an x and a**

- What are NN written in as a coding language?
- ETA value in pytorch?
